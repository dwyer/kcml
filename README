KCML is a recursive acronym for KCML is Casey's Markup Language. As the name implies, it's a markup language I use for personal use. What the name doesn't imply is that it's a simple text-based markup based on common wiki markup that's accompanied by a Python script that converts it to HTML. The project was inspired by LaTeX2HTML, but with markup that's simpler than LaTeX and that produces cleaner and more current-standards-compliant HTML. What it doesn't do (yet) is span across multiple documents.
